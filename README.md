# CDU Code fair website

This is a website I created for my university course, BInfoTech, at Charles Darwin University.

A live copy is available on Github pages, [here](https://chrios.github.io/hit226-assignment-2/).

## How to install

Clone the repo. Open index.html. Alternatively, serve from a web server like [nginx](https://www.nginx.com).
